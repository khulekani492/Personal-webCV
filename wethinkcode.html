        <h1>Self-Learning & Mentors</h1>
        <p>
  I, Khulekani Zondo, approach learning to code by building projects that provide 
  solutions to real-world challengesâ€”whether they affect others or myself personally. 
  Through this approach, I continuously upskill while contributing something meaningful.<br>
  Software development has been a profession I have pursued even before joining WeThinkCode_. 
  During my time at university, I often taught myself how to code, driven by curiosity and passion.
